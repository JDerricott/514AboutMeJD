<h1>Jeff Derricott</h1>
<p>
  My name is Jeff Derricott! I am graduating in a week! Woot! I have been blessed with a lot of experiences here at BYU. I wish I could convey
  in pictures and words all the amazing things about BYU and this department in this app. However, I will just direct you to go to a link
  that describes my major and some things I have learned.
</p>
<p>
  I am the youngest of 5 kids. I have a great life because of BOTH the good times and bad times.
</p>
<p>
  I love hiking, yoga, reading, running, cooking, and gardening!
</p>

  The icon for this app is a well known architectural drawing by Palladio.
